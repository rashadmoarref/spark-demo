{"text": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.","lang": "en","uuid":"acbc47ae-13d8-43a1-9d18-382bd2285180"}
